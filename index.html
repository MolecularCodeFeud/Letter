I am sorry for that, a lot of things have deteriorated my mindscape. I am sorry for all the terrible things I did and I am sorry you have to witness this part of me as well. I promise you I will become a better person to whom you can look up to. 
I love you more than anything and I can't imagine my life without you.</span>
